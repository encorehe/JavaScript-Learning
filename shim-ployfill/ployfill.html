              * What is the difference between a shim and a polyfill?
              * http://www.2ality.com/2011/12/shim-vs-polyfill.html
              * Shim. A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.
              * Polyfill. In October 2010, Remy Sharp blogged about the term “polyfill” [via Rick Waldron]:

                <i>A polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, 
                expect the browser to provide natively. Flattening the API landscape if you will.</i>
